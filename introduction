GO Lang  = bhut hi fast
Performant
efficient Application ham bana skte h,

iska jo synatx h, oo bhut hi, simple h, bhut hi jaldi aap sikh jaoge.

c lang. jaisi fillings ane wali h,
low level lang.
go lang, used by high profile company like:- google, uber, netflix.

bhut sari low level chizo ke bare me sikhne ko milega, jaise ki:-
1. Multi-threading
2. mutexes
3. buffers
4. networks

Golang k use karke aap bhut sari package bana skte ho, cloud application bana skte ho.

Dooker, Kubrneties v go me bana h.

ise v aap andaj laga skte ho ki go kitni powerfull language h.

and one more thing ek iski ki standard libary jo h, oo itni jada capable h, ki apko kise v trh application bana h, to apko iske liye 3rd party package install krne ki koye jrurt ni h.
sari chize jitni v required chize h, oo sb isme mil jati h.

kise v type k application banane ke liye oo apko iski standared library ke andr milega.
jo "in-built" h, iske andr.

// 5. Reason to choose Golang:-

1. Build time       = Fast
Golang has a fast build time, which allows developers to quickly compile and run their applications, enhancing productivity.

jab v apko application ko deploy krna h, to uske liye apko phle build krna hoga, to build krne me kitna time lgta h, y bhut hi important hota h, q ki jab v hm produaction ke andr jo hmre programmes h, usko
use krte h, to y jo build process hoti h, y hoti h, "ci- ct" pipline ke andr, me to  "ci- ct" pipline ke andr, jitna jaldi apka application build ho raha h, utna acha h, q ki "ci-ct ki resource kam use kroge or agr apka application jldi se build hota h, to jldi se aap use test krke ship kr skte ho.
or y go andr y built time bhut km hota h,mtlb bhut hi fast go programme build ho jata h.

2. Fast startup     = Fast
Golang has a fast startup time, which means applications can start quickly, improving the overall user experience.

ki jab v aap application ko deploy karke run karte ho, to usko kitna time lgt h, up and running hone me,mtlb use request ko accept hone me kitna time lgt h, 
y bhut hi important hota h, q ki agar aapka application jldi se up and running ho jata h, to user ko acha experience milta h, or y go andr bhut hi fast hota h,
mtlb aapka application jldi se up and running ho jata h.


3. Performance and efficiency = High
Golang is designed for high performance and efficiency, making it suitable for building scalable applications.

go ke jo programming hote h, n server ke jo resources hote h, apke memory, cpu, or disk, isko kafi efficient tarike se use krte h.

4. Concurrency typing and compilation = Strong
Golang has strong support for concurrency, allowing developers to write programs that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

go rutines h, jo ki jitne v apke multithread jitne v apke server ke , aj kal ke jo model cpus h, uske andr multiple codes hote h, to y golang jo h, oo kya krti h, o sare
course h, usko utlize kr skti h, efficient tarike se.

5. Static typing and compilation = Reliable
Golang uses static typing, which helps catch errors at compile time, leading to more reliable code.

aap jo variable declare krte ho to uska error compile time pr hi aa jata h, isliye aapko run time pr error dekhne ko ni milega.
jo non - static lang. hoti h, uske andr agr koye error h, to production ke andr jane ke bad hame pata chlta h, use ham bach jate h, yaha pe.

NOTE:- jab v ham programme ko build krte h, to jo executable file banti h, ek single file ke andr compile hoti h, 
or uski "size jo h, n oo bhut hi kam" hoti h.

bhut choti size hoti h, as compare to another language.
